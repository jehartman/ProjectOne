# ProjectOne

This was a student project and may not be further developed, but the idea is solid enough. It takes in an address and runs it through the Zillow API to determine latitude and longitude and the high/low prices in the area. Then the lat/long are fed into the Google Maps API to pull out and display a list of nearby places of interest within a 500 meter radius. The current version has the radius hard coded, but future versions could allow users to choose the radius. Also, the map currently returns only "stores" and "places of interest", but a future version could return places of worship, schools. restaurants, etc., and present the user with ability to select particular locations of interest.

It was built using Materialize for the basic page format, and javascript/jQuery.

Project members were Jeff Hartman, James Vera, William Hoy, and Michael McManus.
